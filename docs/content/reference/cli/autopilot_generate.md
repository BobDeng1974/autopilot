## autopilot generate

Generates code, build, and deployment files for the Operator

### Synopsis

The autopilot generate command (re-)generates all assets for coding, building and deploying the Operator.

ap generate should be run whenever the autopilot.yaml, autopilot-operator.yaml, or the spec.go for the top-level CRD have changed.

Re-run this command when you have updated your autopilot.yaml or your api's spec.go.

Note: Kubernetes YAML Manifests generated by ap generate have fields that must be replaced using sed.
The ap deploy command will perform this automatically; however, to apply the manifests by hand:

cat deploy/<resource>.yaml | \
	sed 's/REPLACE_IMAGE/<your-docker-image>/' | \
	sed 's/REPLACE_NAMESPACE/<operator deployment namespace>/' | \
	kubectl apply -f- 



```
autopilot generate [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -d, --deepcopy-only   Only update the zz_generated.deepcopy.go file.
  -h, --help            help for generate
  -f, --overwrite       force overwriting files that are meant to be modified by the user (spec.go, worker.go, etc.)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -v, --verbose   Enable verbose logging
```
